These notes form a concise introductory course on deep generative models.
They are based on Stanford [CS236](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/), taught by [Stefano Ermon](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/) and [Aditya Grover](http://aditya-grover.github.io/), and have been written by [Aditya Grover](http://aditya-grover.github.io/), with the [help](https://github.com/deepgenerativemodels/notes/commits/master) of many students and course staff.
